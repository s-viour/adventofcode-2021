my solutions to [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) in haskell

# usage
the `aoc2021-exe` executable is a command line program with the following usage: 
```
‚ùØ ./aoc2021-exe
usage: aoc2021 [day number] [part number]
```

days and parts that are unimplemented will simply print an error message
